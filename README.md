## Travel Costs

**Live website**: http://travelcosts.herokuapp.com

This is a website to calculat how much a trip would cost.

It takes as input a list of user-entered locations and how many days he plans to spend on each, as well as some basic lifestyle parameters for food, accommodation and transportation. As a result, it displays the cost of the trip.

### Current Version

As of now, only one city is supported for calculations, and no option to set number of days in each location is available
